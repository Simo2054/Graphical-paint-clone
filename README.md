# Graphical-paint-clone

This is a project made with graphics.h library, which aims to mimic the Paint app, on a smaller scale.
The app lets you "paint" on squares with the chosen tool (pencil or bucket) and color on the chosen squares. When the user closes the graphical window, the progress is saved in a matrix format in a text file and once the app runs again, the user can choose between loading the progress, or generating a new empty "canvas".
