# Graphical-paint-clone

This is a project made with graphics.h library, which aims to imitate the Paint app, on a smaller scale.
The app lets you "paint" on squares with a click on tool, then color and then on the chosen square. When the user closes the graphical window, the progress is saved and once the app runs again, the user can choose between loading the progress, or generating a new empty "canvas".
